/**
 * Short-lived per-operation context that resolves queue lifecycle events by diffing
 * the last-known queue membership (from {@link QueueMembershipTracker}) against the
 * post-evaluate state.
 *
 * <h2>Why a tracker, not a live before-snapshot?</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link io.quarkiverse.workitems.runtime.event.WorkItemLifecycleEvent} fires <em>after</em>
 * the WorkItem has already been mutated and persisted in the store. At observation time,
 * {@code workItemStore.get(id)} returns the post-mutation state — the pre-mutation state is gone.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Concrete failure without the tracker:</strong>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // WorkItem is NEWLY CREATED with MANUAL label "legal/contracts" matching queue Q.
 * //
 * // WorkItemService.create() sequence:
 * //   1. persist workItem WITH the label already attached
 * //   2. fire WorkItemLifecycleEvent("CREATED")    ← label is already in the store
 * //
 * // FilterEvaluationObserver.onLifecycleEvent():
 * //   3. workItemStore.get(id) → returns item WITH label  ← post-mutation
 * //
 * // Without tracker — naive live snapshot:
 * //   before = computeMembership(liveEntity) = {Q}  ← label already present!
 * //   evaluate(wi) → label survives → after = {Q}
 * //   before == after → CHANGED fires              ← WRONG: should be ADDED
 * //
 * // With tracker:
 * //   before = tracker.getBefore(id) = {}           ← no prior history for new item
 * //   evaluate(wi) → label survives → after = {Q}
 * //   {} vs {Q} → ADDED fires                      ← correct
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The same failure occurs for label removal: the label is deleted before the event fires,
 * so a live snapshot would also yield {} before and {} after, producing no event instead
 * of the correct {@code REMOVED}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The tracker bridges this by recording the after-state at the end of each event — which
 * is the correct before-state for the next event. It is DB-backed (V2001 migration) so
 * state survives JVM restarts.
 *
 * <h2>Event semantics</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>In before, not in after → {@link QueueEventType#REMOVED}</li>
 * <li>Not in before, in after → {@link QueueEventType#ADDED}</li>
 * <li>In both before and after → {@link QueueEventType#CHANGED} — item went through the
 * INFERRED-label strip + re-apply cycle and remained a queue member; signals that
 * the WorkItem's state changed while queue membership was preserved</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Testability</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link #resolve(WorkItem, List, Consumer)} accepts the full {@link QueueView} list as a
 * parameter (rather than fetching it internally via Panache) and emits events via a
 * {@link Consumer}. This allows pure unit tests with no Quarkus runtime, no CDI, and no DB:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<WorkItemQueueEvent> fired = new ArrayList<>();
 * new QueueMembershipContext(workItemId, before).resolve(wi, queues, fired::add);
 * assertThat(fired).hasSize(1).first().extracting(...).isEqualTo(ADDED);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In production, {@link FilterEvaluationObserver} passes {@code queueEventBus::fire}.
 *
 * <h2>GC lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * Created as a local variable in {@link FilterEvaluationObserver}. Falls out of scope
 * immediately after {@code resolve()} returns — no CDI scope, no static reference holds it.
