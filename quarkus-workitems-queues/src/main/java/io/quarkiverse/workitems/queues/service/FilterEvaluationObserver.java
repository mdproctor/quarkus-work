/**
 * CDI observer: bridges {@link WorkItemLifecycleEvent} to the filter evaluation engine
 * and queue lifecycle event system.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is the sole integration point between the core WorkItems extension and the
 * queues module. For each WorkItem lifecycle event:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Before-state</strong> — retrieves the last-known queue membership from
 * {@link QueueMembershipTracker} (DB-backed; correct across JVM restarts).</li>
 * <li><strong>Queue snapshot</strong> — fetches all {@link QueueView}s once per event
 * so the same list is used for both the before→after diff and pattern matching.</li>
 * <li><strong>Create context</strong> — constructs a short-lived {@link QueueMembershipContext}
 * holding the before-state. No CDI scope; GC-eligible after {@code resolve()} returns.</li>
 * <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> — runs the filter engine: strips all INFERRED labels,
 * re-applies them via multi-pass evaluation, persists the updated WorkItem.</li>
 * <li><strong>Resolve</strong> — diffs before vs after, emits {@link WorkItemQueueEvent}
 * (ADDED / REMOVED / CHANGED) for each affected queue, returns the after-state.</li>
 * <li><strong>Update tracker</strong> — stores the after-state for the next event.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Why the before-state comes from the tracker, not from the live entity</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link WorkItemLifecycleEvent} fires <em>after</em> the WorkItem has already been
 * mutated and persisted. When this observer calls {@code workItemStore.get(id)},
 * it receives the post-mutation entity. There is no "before" accessible from the store.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Counter-example — what breaks if you use the live entity as "before":</strong>
 *
 * <p>
 * Suppose a WorkItem is created with the MANUAL label {@code "legal/contracts"}, which
 * matches queue Q. The creation flow is:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@code WorkItemService.create()} persists the item <em>including the label</em>.</li>
 * <li>{@code lifecycleEvent.fire(CREATED)} is called — the label is already in the store.</li>
 * <li>This observer runs; {@code workItemStore.get(id)} returns the item <em>with the label</em>.</li>
 * <li>If "before" were built from the live entity: before = {Q} (label already there).</li>
 * <li>After {@code evaluate()}: label survives → after = {Q}.</li>
 * <li>before == after → {@code CHANGED} fires. <strong>Wrong — it should be {@code ADDED}.</strong></li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The same failure occurs for label removal: the label is deleted before the event fires,
 * so the live entity has no label, making before = {} and after = {} — no event fires at all,
 * missing the expected {@code REMOVED}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>The tracker solves this</strong> by recording the resolved queue membership at the
 * end of each event (after {@code evaluate()} and before the transaction commits). For a new
 * item, the tracker has no entry → before = {} → ADDED fires correctly. For a label removal,
 * the tracker still holds the membership from the previous event → before = {Q} → REMOVED fires.
 *
 * <h2>CHANGED vs spurious REMOVED + ADDED</h2>
 * <p>
 * The filter engine strips all INFERRED labels before re-applying them. Without
 * coordination, a naive event emitter would fire REMOVED (during strip) then ADDED
 * (on re-apply) for items that never truly left the queue. The before/after diff in
 * {@link QueueMembershipContext} collapses this pair into a single CHANGED event.
