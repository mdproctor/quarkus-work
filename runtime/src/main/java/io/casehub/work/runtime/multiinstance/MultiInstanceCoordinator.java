/**
 * Observes terminal {@link WorkItemLifecycleEvent} instances asynchronously and
 * delegates to {@link MultiInstanceGroupPolicy} to update group counters and
 * evaluate the M-of-N threshold.
 *
 * <p>
 * Using {@link ObservesAsync} ensures the child WorkItem's transaction is already
 * committed before the coordinator runs, so the policy sees consistent data.
 * {@link MultiInstanceGroupPolicy#process} is {@code @Transactional} and handles
 * its own transaction boundary.
 *
 * <p>
 * Group lifecycle events are fired <em>after</em> {@code process()} returns — i.e.
 * after the transaction commits — so that a concurrent transaction that rolls back
 * with OCC does not emit a spurious event.
 *
 * <p>
 * A single retry handles the rare case where two siblings complete concurrently
 * and contend on the spawn-group version column. In Quarkus/Narayana JTA, OCC
 * detected at commit time propagates as {@code RollbackException} wrapping
 * {@code OptimisticLockException} — catching the broad {@link Exception} type
 * ensures the retry fires regardless of how the JTA layer wraps the failure.
 * On the second attempt {@code policyTriggered=true} makes {@code process()}
 * return {@code null}, so the retry is safe even if the first attempt partially succeeded.
