/**
 * Persistent record of a WorkItem's membership in a single {@link QueueView}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code work_item_queue_membership} table is the authoritative "before-state"
 * used by {@link io.casehub.work.queues.service.QueueMembershipContext} to
 * diff queue membership changes across JVM restarts. Without this table the tracker
 * would be in-memory only, and every restart would re-fire {@code ADDED} events for
 * all items currently in any queue.
 *
 * <p>
 * Managed exclusively by {@link io.casehub.work.queues.service.QueueMembershipTracker}.
 * Never written or read by any other component.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Rows are inserted (or replaced) each time {@code QueueMembershipTracker.update()} runs.</li>
 * <li>All rows for a given {@code workItemId} are deleted and re-inserted atomically
 * within the same transaction as the {@code WorkItemLifecycleEvent} that triggered them.</li>
 * <li>When a WorkItem leaves all queues, all its rows are deleted — no orphan rows.</li>
 * </ul>
